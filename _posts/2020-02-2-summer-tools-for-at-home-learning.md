Determine when student(s) will complete each task and stick to a schedule! Developing & maintaining a summer routine is crucial to cultivating a conducive learning environment.

- Summer Bridge Book.
- Grade Specific Math curriculum book (GoMath etc.)
- 2-3 Minute Math Drills for math facts
- Reading Level Appropriate List (“Just Right Books”) (can use websites like scholastic to determine reading level of a book)https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/bookwizard/
- Specific Writing Prompts (based on book being read). Grades 2-3: 1 paragraph, Grades 3-5: 2-3 paragraphs
- Daily Journal (Students write about their daily routines & activities the purpose of this task is to reinforce and strengthen writing skills, creative writing is not necessary for this task)

These are a few to get stared.

Go and have fun with it!
